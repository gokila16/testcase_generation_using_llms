"""
prompt_builder_simple.py

Three prompts for the simplified pipeline used on the `simple` bucket:
  - build_simple_plan_prompt(method)              → enumerates test cases (no code)
  - build_simple_generation_prompt(method, plan)  → writes Java tests under a strict allowlist
  - build_simple_retry_prompt(method, code, error)→ fixes errors, allowlist still applies

Anti-hallucination strategy:
  1. The plan prompt sees only signature/body/javadoc — no API surface to hallucinate.
  2. The generation prompt receives an explicit "ALLOWED METHOD CALLS" list built
     from the method's Understand-derived `dependency_signatures` plus the SUT
     class's own public methods/constructors from class_inventory.json. The
     prompt forbids any other method or class.
  3. For overloaded methods the exact signature being tested is highlighted; the
     generated test class is named with the overload index; sibling overloads
     are explicitly listed with a "do not test these" callout so the LLM doesn't
     conflate them.
  4. Imports are constrained to the SUT's own `source_file_imports` plus JUnit
     Jupiter — preventing fabricated import paths.
  5. The same package as the SUT is forbidden as an import (Checkstyle's
     RedundantImport rule fails the build otherwise).

Inputs are dict-shaped method records from extracted_metadata_simple.json
plus a class_inventory dict. The caller (pipeline_step3_simple) injects two
extra fields into the method dict before calling these:
    method["_test_class_name"] — e.g. PDColor_PDColor_0_Test
    method["_package"]         — e.g. org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.graphics.color

=== ALLOWED CLASSES TO IMPORT (verbatim — copied from the SUT's source file) ===
{_format_imports(imports)}

  (Plus implicitly available: java.lang.*, org.junit.jupiter.api.Test, org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*)

=== ALLOWED EXTERNAL METHOD CALLS (Understand-derived from this method's body) ===
{_format_dep_lines(deps, class_inventory)}

=== ALLOWED PUBLIC API ON THE SUT CLASS ({class_name}) ===
{_format_sut_api(class_inventory, full_name, class_name)}

=== HARD CONSTRAINTS — VIOLATIONS WILL FAIL THE BUILD ===
1. Do NOT invent method names, class names, parameter names, field names, or constants.
   Use ONLY identifiers that appear in this prompt.
2. The ONLY methods you may call are:
     (a) Items listed under "ALLOWED EXTERNAL METHOD CALLS" or "ALLOWED PUBLIC API ON THE SUT CLASS"
     (b) JUnit Jupiter assertions: {", ".join(_JUNIT_ASSERTIONS)}
     (c) Plain language built-ins: java.lang.* (Object.equals, String literals, primitive ops, etc.)
3. The ONLY classes you may import are those listed under "ALLOWED CLASSES TO IMPORT",
   plus org.junit.jupiter.api.Test and org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions (use a static import).
4. Do NOT import any class from the package `{package}` itself — you are already in that package
   (Checkstyle flags self-package imports as RedundantImport and the build fails).
5. Use INDIVIDUAL static imports for assertions:
     import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
     import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertThrows;
   Do NOT use the wildcard form `import static ...Assertions.*;` — PDFBox's Checkstyle
   config disallows wildcard imports and will fail the build.
6. The body of the method under test is shown for context ONLY. Do NOT reference any
   private or protected field, method, constant, or inner class — even when you see them
   in the body. Test ONLY the public surface listed above. Anything not explicitly listed
   under the ALLOWED sections is private / package-private / protected by default.
7. Classes tagged `[ABSTRACT]` or `[INTERFACE]` in the allowlists CANNOT be instantiated
   with `new`. If you need an instance of one, either pass `null` with a cast like
   `(MyAbstract) null`, or look for a concrete subclass listed in the allowlists.
   The same applies if the SUT class itself is tagged ABSTRACT/INTERFACE — your test
   should call its public methods on `null` with a cast (which will throw NPE — assert
   that), or skip exercising those code paths.
8. Class declaration MUST be exactly:
     package {package};
     ... imports ...
     public class {test_class} {{ ... }}
9. Each test method must be public, void, take no arguments, and be annotated `@Test`.
10. Implement one `@Test` method per item in the test plan above. Cover all of them.
11. For null arguments where the method has overloads with the same arity, use a
    parameter-type cast like `(float[]) null` to disambiguate `javac`.
12. If you cannot construct an argument from the allowed list, pass `null` with an
    explicit cast like `(SomeType) null`. Do NOT instantiate types not listed above.
13. Do NOT use Mockito, PowerMock, or any other mocking library — only JUnit 5.

=== PRE-FLIGHT CHECK (do this mentally before submitting) ===
For every line of code you wrote, verify:
  • Every method call `obj.foo(...)` — `foo` appears in either ALLOWED EXTERNAL METHOD
    CALLS or ALLOWED PUBLIC API ON THE SUT CLASS (or it's a JUnit Jupiter assertion).
  • Every class name `X` you wrote — `X` appears in ALLOWED CLASSES TO IMPORT,
    or in the allowlists, or in java.lang.*.
  • Every `new X(...)` — `X` is NOT tagged `[ABSTRACT]` or `[INTERFACE]`, AND the
    constructor signature you used appears verbatim in ALLOWED PUBLIC API or
    ALLOWED EXTERNAL METHOD CALLS.
  • Every field reference `X.SOMETHING` — that constant or static field is documented
    in this prompt. Otherwise it's private or invented; remove it.
If any line fails this check, remove or rewrite it before submitting.

1. Read the error message carefully and fix ONLY what it points to.

4. Same allowlist applies: only the methods, classes, and assertions listed here.
5. Same package, same test class name. Do NOT import any class from `{package}`.
6. For null arguments where an overload-set has the same arity, cast like `(float[]) null`.
7. If checkstyle flagged `RedundantImport`, remove the offending self-package import line.
8. If checkstyle flagged a wildcard import (e.g. `import static ...Assertions.*`), replace
   it with individual static imports for each assertion you actually use.
9. If javac said "cannot find symbol", the called method/field is not on the allowlist —
   remove that line or replace it with a method that IS on the allowlist.
10. If javac said "has private/protected access", you accessed a non-public member.
    Remove that access; only public members may be touched from a test in another package.
11. If javac said "is abstract; cannot be instantiated", change `new SomeAbstractClass(...)`
    to either `(SomeAbstractClass) null` or to a concrete subclass listed in the allowlists.
12. If javac said "no suitable constructor/method found", check the parameter types of
    your call against the signature in the allowlist — fix the arg types or wrap nulls
    with a type cast.
