# rebuild_understand_db.ps1
#
# Rebuilds the SciTools Understand database for PDFBox so it spans every
# module the test-generation pipeline depends on -- not just `pdfbox`, but
# also `pdfbox-io` and `pdfbox-rendering`. This is the Tier 1 fix for the
# "Unknown Class" gap surfaced by probe_understand_refs.py: classes like
# RandomAccessReadBufferedFile and IOUtils are referenced by methods in
# `pdfbox`, but their definitions live in `pdfbox-io` and were never analyzed
# into the original main.und, so Understand could not report their
# constructors/methods.
#
# The script writes a NEW database at:
#   PDFBOX-v5\pdfbox\src\main\main_full.und
#
# The original main.und is left untouched, so the existing extractor and the
# probe keep working unchanged. Once you've verified the new DB with the
# probe, point both scripts at main_full.und.
#
# Usage:
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\rebuild_understand_db.ps1
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\rebuild_understand_db.ps1 -Force
#
# -Force skips the "delete existing DB?" prompt and overwrites without asking.
